          My dearest Rojina, from the moment our paths crossed, my world became infinitely brighter.
          Every laugh, every quiet moment, every adventure – they are all treasures I hold dear.
          You inspire me, challenge me, and make me feel like the luckiest person alive.
          On your birthday, I want to celebrate not just the amazing person you are today, but the
          incredible journey we've embarked on and all the beautiful moments yet to come. You mean
          everything to me. Happy Birthday, my love! ❤️
